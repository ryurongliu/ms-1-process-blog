    <p>
      These prototypes explore the flattening of information that occurs in the creation of sound and in other cognitive
      processes that combine "pure" thought with physical manipulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many theories, structures, and ideas that go into the making of sounds using various techniques. However,
      when these sounds are physically heard, the cognitive process of creation is flattened into a single sonic experience.
      Similar loss of information occurs with Rubik's Cubes and with chess. The external physical movements of Rubik's Cube faces omit the
      pattern recognition and problem-solving that go into finding a solution, and the external physical movements
      of chess pieces around the board omit the strategy and future-thinking that go into playing chess.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this week, I used different methods of creating sound to explore a cycle of sonification and reverse
      sonification with Rubik's Cubes and chess. I turned purely physical aspects of sound
      into Rubik's Cube or chess positions, and then turned the cognitive processes of Rubik's cube solving or chess-playing
      back into sound.

    <p>
      The initial goal was to externalize cognition through sound, to make thought processes <i>known</i> instead of
      <i>flattened</i>.
      However, these experiments showed that to properly externalize cognition requires more than just sonification:
      the addition of spatial and visual elements would likely be more successful, especially with these particular
      cognitive processes (creating sound, solving Rubik's cubes, playing chess) that combine "pure" thought with physical
      manipulation.

    <h3>Which was the most challenging or surprising project for you?</h3>
    <p>I found Project 4, turning music into chess moves, to be the most challenging. I don’t actually know much
      about chess strategy or notation, so I had to learn how to use the Python chess library while also learning
      how chess is notated and the various formats in which chess games are saved. This was frustrating but
      extremely informative, and I learned a lot just by trawling through the package documentation.</p>
    <p>Similarly, I also faced a surprising amount of difficulty trying to figure out how to find the audio onsets.
      I tried using a peak-finding algorithm from a previous research project, but I quickly realized that
      peak-finding is actually quite different from finding onsets. I had to do some extensive googling to
      even find the proper term, “onsets”, for what I was describing, and then it took a lot more googling
      to find a python package that could properly analyze them. I tried a few packages before landing
      on essentia, but then I also had a lot of issues downloading the package due to various environment issues. </p>
    <p>This project also really surprised me in how “interesting” the generated mid game position turned out.
      I thought I would get something totally nonsensical due to the essentially “random” nature of movements,
      but my friend and I actually had a really fruitful game from the mid game position. I’m curious whether
      assigning different tracks to different pieces would significantly affect the “interesting-ness” of
      the generated position. I also wonder if, compared to completely novice players who only know the
      very basic moving rules of chess, this kind of simulation is any “worse” at making moves. This
      project definitely brought up some interesting questions of chess strategy and chess cognition
      - I also wonder what would happen if I involved a chess engine in the process of choosing moves,
      to weight the possible legal moves by their advantage some how. </p>


    <h3>Did you receive any feedback that made you curious or frustrated with a particular project?</h3>
    <p>Yoshe’s comment on whether the cube music was meant to be musical or generative gave me the insight
      that generative music doesn’t actually have to be musical! A lot of the generative stuff I’ve made before
      has attempted to be musical, so it was interesting to see a different perspective where generative
      music can be interesting because it is generative. This makes me feel a bit better about making g
      enerative music that doesn’t sound “good” by musical standards, and I feel like it changed some
      fundamental bias I was holding onto that only “musical” music is “good” music. </p>
    <p>I also thought it was interesting that multiple people asked about automating the sonification processes,
      since I was thinking about designing them specifically so the human element was unavoidably necessary.
      I think this was probably a flaw in my presentation  of the projects, but part of it also lies in the
      fact that - as I discussed with Clarinda after class - human cognition can’t really be represented in
       sound, precisely because the flattening nature of sound. It does demand multiple dimensions, and I
        think in trying to use only sound as a representation, it makes the process seem much more automated
        than I wanted it to be. </p>

      <h3>If you were to do another iteration of the project what would you change or refine?</h3>
      <p>I would definitely try to put more thought into the ideation, and spend less time on the implementation.
        I think if I had reflected a bit more during the week, I would have recognized the flaw in only
        relying on sonification earlier, and I would’ve spent more time ideating on spatial and visual
        complements to the sound. I would probably go back to each sonification process and think about
        how to add these components. I’d also want to think more about how I could create a semi-automated
        program that guides the user through inputting their thoughts in order to walk through this cycle,
        so that each person could come away with their own unique cyclic generations. </p>

      <h3>Can you see an emergent theme in your work, an aesthetic, logic or approach?</h3>
      <p>I think this project helped me realize that a lot of what I’ve done is focused on trying to externalize
        human cognition within the technical frameworks that guide our thought processes. I also tend to try and
        have people’s involvement be an integral part of the “generation” process, which more often than not takes
        the form of sound. These two things make sense together for me, since one thing I’ve thought a lot about
        is how we can make ourselves known to each other, in terms of the way our individual minds work. The piece
        I was missing before was the externalization of human thought processes, and I think going forward this
        will help me better focus my future work. </p>
      <p>One other thing that I noticed from this project is that I tend to get bogged down in the logic and end
        up creating things that feel almost sterile because of their intense technicality. This is something I
        continue to struggle with, and it's especially frustrating because I am explicitly trying to represent
        the human element within all the technical frameworks. I definitely want to keep working on being looser
        with my ideas, and letting the people-interactions flow through rather than scripting them so tightly.</p>
