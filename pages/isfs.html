    <h2>Documentation</h2>
    <h3>Part 1: Ideating</h3>
    <p>We started the project by choosing a location. Since Yoshe lives in
    Jersey City, and I live in the UES, we ended up choosing the High Line as
    a good central point that we've both been to before. Before going to the High Line,
    we agreed to read the Whyte paper and do some research on the High Line.</p>
    [my research notes]
    <p>On Thursday 9/8, we met up and visited the High Line, starting at the southernmost
    point and walking north. We saw some interesting things, including a scary water feature,
    signage directing people away from plants, and lots of large open spaces.</p>
    [some pictures of that stuff]
    <p>These open spaces were pretty empty, so we kept going. We eventually reached the 14th Street
    entrance, where we were drawn to the staircase leading up from the street. We thought this might be
    a good intervention point, since the placement of the stairs would allow for sneaky documenting from above. </p>
    [picture of staircase]
    <p>We walked around the staircase and talked about some ideas, and then we kept going.</p>
    <p>After the staircase, we walked to our main location, the split pathways with the water feature
    on one side. We actually first walked on the empty side and weren't all that impressed, but once we
    reached the north end of that stretch and heard the water feature, we were drawn to the east side.</p>
    [pictures of water feature ]
    <p>We were both really interested in the water feature and decided to use this as the location instead.
    We spent about half an hour walking up and down that eastern side, people-watching, and dicussing possible
    ideas for our intervention.</p>
    [piictures of water feature ]
    <p>We settled on the idea of having something swinging down and causing an obstruction, because it almost
    seemed like people were purposefully walking in the crowded areas and seeking out obstruction. We originally
    thought about hanging it from the trees above the path, but the branches seemed a bit too fragile and we
    weren't sure how to get up to them as they were quite high.</p>
    [pictures of trees]
    <p>We also considered the scaffolding on the south end of this stretch. It was a bit more out of the way, but
    still close enough to the staircase and visible from the water feature walkway, so it seemed like a good
    compromise. </p>

    <p>We met up again on Sunday 9/11 to refine our ideas and put together our presentation.</p>

    <h3>Part 2: Incorporating Feedback & Early Prototyping </h3>
    <p>After getting feedback in class on Monday 9/12, we realized that we would have to test different heights,
    sizes, and weights of the hanging object, in order to make sure it wasn't harmful to passersby. We decided
    to test differently sized stuffed animals at different heights as quick prototypes to find the best height.</p>
    <p>On Wednesday 9/14, we met up before class at a fabric shop and got some red and blue-flowered fabric
    for the object and the rope. After the in-class activity, we performed some tests with two differently sized
    pet collars I had on hand. We decided to use the larger size as it would stand out more, but was still
    small enough to maneuver around without difficulty.</p>
    [pictures/video]
    <p>We decided that head-height of an average adult would be a good starting point for the object, since that would
    catch people's attention the most. We also tested the safety of having it hit you in the head, and we decided to
    stuff the objects with fabric scraps or with stuffed animal stuffing, if we could borrow some from the xFab materials.</p>
    [video of hitting head]
    <p>We also decided to keep the donut shape instead of the original spherical shape. This made it easier to attach the
    rope, and it also gave people a handle to pull on.</p>
    <p>Finally, we tested out the braiding of the rope using one strip of red felt and two strips of blue fabric. We
    talked about sewing the blue strips in half to hide the white side of the fabric, but it actually worked out well enough
    by just folding it in half and braiding it.</p>
    [pictures/video]
    <p>The braided rope was super strong and could be easily adjusted for length, so we were happy with it.</p>

    <h3>Part 3: Fabrication </h3>
    <p>On Thursday 9/15, we started making the 'final' objects. We sewed three more strips onto each of the
      braid lengths, using diagonal connections for more strength.</p>

    <p> Then, for the donuts, we used the red felt to cut out four donut shapes,
    and sewed them along the outside edge using the D12 Prototyping Lab sewing machine. </p>
    [picture]
    <p>Since the donut shape has a hole in it, you can't sew all the edges and then turn it inside out like a
    normal plushie, so we turned them inside out just with the outside edges sewn closed.</p>
    [picture]
    <p>We then stuffed the donuts with scraps of the red felt and blue fabric, and then handsewed the inside
    edges closed.</p>
    [picture]
    <p>The donuts came out a little smaller than anticipated, so we felt that sewing hand cutouts onto them
    wouldn't be very visible. Instead, we decided to add handle/grip areas out of blue fabric, kind of like
    for gymnastics rings.</p>
    []
    <p>Finally, Yoshe printed some tests of posters with different colored backgrounds. We ended up using one
    with a lighter green background and some darker coloring around the objects to make them stand out. </p>

    <h3>Part 4: Installation</h3>
    <p>We met up on Sunday 9/18 to do the actual installation around 1:30 pm. We had to pivot to a slightly
    different location on the scaffolding since the rope wasn't long enough for the original area we wanted.
    Luckily, there was some crossbracing nearby that allowed me to climb up and thread the rope through very
    easily. </p>
    [picture]
    <p>We put up two posters, one on each side.</p>
    [picture]
    <p>We only left it up for around 20 minutes or so, since a person wearing a High Line Staff shirt came by
    and seemed to be calling a manager about it. I took a sneaky walk by and he was calling it a "children's toy",
    which was kind of interesting. He eventually left, but we weren't sure if someone else was going to come by and
    take it down, so we decided to end the intervention. </p>
    <h3>Part 5: Interactions<h3>
      <p>We got a lot of really good interactions, as shown in the video below: </p>
