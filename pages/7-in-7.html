    <h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
    <p>
      These prototypes explore the flattening of information that occurs in the creation of sound and in other cognitive
      processes that combine "pure" thought with physical manipulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many theories, structures, and ideas that go into the making of sounds using various techniques. However,
      when these sounds are physically heard, the cognitive process of creation is flattened into a single sonic experience.
      Similar loss of information occurs with Rubik's Cubes and with chess. The external physical movements of Rubik's Cube faces omit the
      pattern recognition and problem-solving that go into finding a solution, and the external physical movements
      of chess pieces around the board omit the strategy and future-thinking that go into playing chess.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this week, I used different methods of creating sound to explore a cycle of sonification and reverse
      sonification with Rubik's Cubes and chess. I turned purely physical aspects of sound
      into Rubik's Cube or chess positions, and then turned the cognitive processes of Rubik's cube solving or chess-playing
      back into sound.
    </p>

    <p>
      The initial goal was to externalize cognition through sound, to make thought processes <i>known</i> instead of
      <i>flattened</i>.
      However, these experiments showed that to properly externalize cognition requires more than just sonification:
      the addition of spatial and visual elements would likely be more successful, especially with these particular
      cognitive processes (creating sound, solving Rubik's cubes, playing chess) that combine "pure" thought with physical
      manipulation.

    <h3 id="proj-1">Project 1: OP-1 Music</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Goal:</b> make a simple track using the OP-1 synthesizer, borrowed from Yoshe.
    </p>
    <img src="../images/7-in-7/op-1.JPG" class='row-img'>
    <p>
      <b>Result:</b>
    </p>
    <audio controls>
            <source src="../audio/7-in-7/op1-music.wav" type="audio/wav">
  </audio>
    <p>
      <b>Process:</b> I referenced the <a href="https://teenage.engineering/_img/6275254dfb267f0004b9e832_original.pdf" target="_blank">OP-1 manual</a> to learn the basics of using the machine.
    </p>

  <p>
    <b>Reflection:</b> The synthesizer interface was very intuitive, but the process itself of making and layering loops is
    quite different from how I usually approach creating music. It's very easy to lose sound settings,
    and it's difficult to undo recorded tracks without deleting everything. This built-in "flattening"
    of information is part of the charm of the synthesizer, which is stylized after old-timey tape recorders.
    Tracks made on the OP-1 aren't "meant" to be replicated in the same way as composing sheet music, but it
    would be interesting to see if this ephemerality could be captured with some sort of notation, especially
    for teaching new users.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Future Explorations:</b> This synthesizer occupies a very interesting spot in terms of accessibility: it is easier to
    understand than any other physical synthesizer I've ever used, yet its price ($1299) puts it out of reach for
    any synth beginners. Given another few days, I'd like to explore possible notations that might bring the
    synth's usability to a wider audience, especially for teaching the basics of synthesizers and loop-based
    composition.

    <h3 id="proj-2">Project 2/7: OP-1 Music --> Rubik's Cube Scramble (PHYSICAL)</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Goal:</b> Use purely physical elements of the OP-1 music to generate a Rubik's Cube scramble (Project 2).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Sub-goal:</b> Visualize this generation (Project 7).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Result:</b> Using a data-processing approach, I used the waveforms of the OP-1 tracks to
      generate a Rubik's Cube scramble, shown below.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Process:</b> I used Python to load in the audio files, including both the stereo master track and the four
      mono layered tracks. I split the master into its two channels, giving me a total of six tracks that I then mapped
      to the six faces of the Rubik's Cube.
    </p>
    <img src="../images/7-in-7/op1-to-cube-face-map.png" class='single-img' style="width: 70%;">
    <p>
      I then "binned" each wave, turning the data into a collection of points and lines. The binning
      process splits the data into equal timechunks, takes the average amplitude in that chunk as the y-value of the
      new point, and takes the time at which the original wave was closest to the average amplitude as the x-value of
      the new point. This allows for automated binning that also creates points with unique timestamps (x-values).
    </p>
    <img src="../images/7-in-7/op1-binned.png" class='single-img' style="width: 70%;">
    <p>Then, for each binned track, I converted each line segment into a clockwise or counterclockwise turn of
      the track's mapped face, with upwards lines (positive slope) corresponding to clockwise turns, and downwards lines
      (negative slopes) corresponding to counterclockwise turns. Each turn had a timestamp according to where
      the line started or stopped.
    </p>
    <img src="../images/7-in-7/track-notations.png" class='row-img'">
    <p> Finally, all the movements for all the faces were consolidated and ordered by timestamps to create the final scramble.
    </p>
    <img src="../images/7-in-7/final-scramble.png" class='row-img'">
    <p>
      The scramble is notated according to conventional <a href="https://jperm.net/3x3/moves" target="_blank">
        Rubik's Cube notation</a>: L, R, F, B, U, D means Left, Right,
      Front, Back, Up, and Down faces, and an apostrophe means counterclockwise (no apostrophe means clockwise).
      Double moves are denoted with the number 2. For example, a scramble notated as "U R2 L'" means "turn the Up face
      clockwise, then turn the Right face twice, and then turn the Left face counterclockwise".
    </p>
    <p>
      On the seventh day, I created an animated website in p5.js
      (<a href="https://ryurongliu.github.io/7-in-7-project-7/ ">linked here</a>) to visualize the process of generating
      the scramble. It has some issues animating correctly at different screen aspect ratios, but the overall idea
      was to see the binning and notation extraction in "real-time".
