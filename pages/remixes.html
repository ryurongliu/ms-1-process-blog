    <h3>What was your experience with the Design Sprints?</h3>
    <p>
      I quite enjoyed the design sprint activities. I liked that they were short
      enough to do in-class at the beginning of the week, but they were intensive
      enough to produce some really interesting ideas and work through a good number
      of potential ideas. I also liked that we worked with the same team for both
      sprints, as it let us get used to each others' workflow. I do think the prompts
      were written a bit confusingly, particularly regarding how many ideas we should have
      and how exactly to create the user personas. I felt that we also lacked some
      guidance for what to include in the slides in the second sprint; it might make
      sense to put the same five-slide breakdown again in the second sprint brief.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also felt that the pacing was much more manageable than the ISFS project, since
      we had a good amount of class time to work on things. The in-class versus outside of class
      work balance felt much better, and it was nice to have time over the weekend to
      take a break and gather our thoughts about users. I do wonder if doing this assignment
      first rather than ISFS might be a better way to start the studio; I think we learned
      a lot of valuable lessons about user needs and repurposing existing structures that I
      think could be really fun to apply to ISFS.
    </p>
    <h3>What was one thing you learned about your collaboration style?</h3>
    <p>
      I learned that I am definitely an organizer in a collaborative setting. I tend
      to be the one setting up meetings or listing out what needs to get done. I am
      usually extremely organized in my personal life in a similar way, so I think I
      naturally gravitate towards this kind of role. I do think that sometimes I can
      be a bit too worried about getting things done early, which I'm trying to work
      on both for personal projects and for group projects.
    </p>
    <h3>What was one new thing you observed about how to think about "users?"</h3>
    <p>
      I found it really valuable to think about disability as a mismatch
      between personal needs and societal design. This framework led
      me to analyze everyday designs to figure out who is implicitly included
      and excluded. It also made me feel more justified in my own daily
      frustrations I have with poorly designed systems and interfaces; I can
      recognize that it's not my personal failing for struggling to use something,
      but rather it's a failure in design that something is difficult to use.
